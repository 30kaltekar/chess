What did you learn during this project?

We learned about the minimax algorithm and how to evaluate which moves are better than others. We also learned how to efficiently design classes and simplify our code.


What did you enjoy during this project?

Watching minimax bots play against each other is fun, as is beating the easy-level bot. Finishing the minimax was also enjoyable, as we wouldn't need to do any more minimax debugging.


What did you find challenging or frustrating during this project?

Visualizing the minimax algorithm's decisions was difficult and it was hard to confirm it had the correct behavior.
