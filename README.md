# Chess
A console-based chess game in Java with a minimax bot to play against.

## Known Issues
* The minimax player is not very good and makes weird decisions sometimes
* A summary of all moves cannot be printed when the game is over
    * This is due to the implementation of the Move class and its toString() method
